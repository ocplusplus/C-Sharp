/*Create the class SavingsAccount. Use the static read-write property AnnualInterestRate to store the annual interest rate for all account holders. 
Each object of the class contains a property SavingsBalance, indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit. 
Provide method CalculateMonthlyInterest to calculate the monthly interest by multiplying the SavingsBalance by AnnualInterestRate 
divided by 12-this interest should be added to savings-Balance. Write an app to test class SavingsAccount. Create two savingsAccount objects, 
saver1 and saver2, with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively. Set AnnualInterestRate to 4% then calculate the monthly interest and display 
the new balances for both savers. Then set the AnnualInterestRate to 5%, calculate the next monthâ€™s interest and display the new balances for both savers.*/
