# CSharp-NameSorter
Built a name sorter in C#. Given a set of names, it is ordered first by last names, then by any given names the person may have. Names processed by this sorter have a last name and a minimum of one given name with a maximum of three given names. 
NB:Used Visual Studio 2022 to build program.
